# Classification-Imballanced-data-set


The public card dataset consists of financial transactions and is commonly used for fraud detection tasks. The dataset includes:

Time: Time elapsed since the first transaction in the dataset. V1 to V28: 28 anonymized features resulting from dimensionality reduction, capturing transaction patterns while protecting sensitive information. Amount: Monetary value of the transaction. Class: Target variable indicating fraud (1) or non-fraud (0).
Classifying with Highly Imbalanced Datasets

Due to the rarity of fraudulent transactions (about 0.17% of the data), classifying such imbalanced datasets presents significant challenges:

Model Bias: Traditional models may bias towards the majority class (non-fraudulent) and fail to detect the minority class (fraudulent) effectively. Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy is not a reliable performance metric. Instead, metrics like precision, recall and F1-score should be used.
Approaches

XGBoost: A powerful gradient boosting model that handles class imbalance through parameter tuning and class weight adjustment. It performs well with large datasets and provides robust classification.

LightGBM: An efficient gradient boosting framework known for speed and accuracy. It includes options for handling class imbalance and is suitable for large-scale datasets.

Autoencoders: A neural network-based approach used for anomaly detection. Autoencoders can learn to reconstruct the majority class and identify anomalies (fraudulent transactions) based on reconstruction error.

These methods can be employed individually or in combination to enhance performance in detecting fraudulent transactions and dealing with class imbalance.
